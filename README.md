# autodelete

does what it says it does. ignores pinned messages in-channel.

usage: `/autodelete channel:#general enabled:true|false minutes:60`

you can omit minutes if you're disabling it in a channel

todo: maybe support removing pins as a toggle, maybe pin a message from the robot in the channel saying what it's doing

venmo me @a_letson if you like it and want to support its operation
